# AutoTransitionApp

Auto DJ System is a Python-based intelligent mix recommendation engine designed for DJs and music enthusiasts. It analyzes audio tracks and recommends the next best song to mix based on BPM, musical key compatibility, energy level, and waveform similarity. Using powerful signal processing libraries like librosa, the system extracts key audio features from each track and computes a custom similarity score to ensure smooth, harmonic transitions. Ideal for live sets, practice sessions, or playlist curation, this project bridges the gap between machine learning and DJ performance. Future plans include GUI support, Rekordbox/Traktor integration, and user-trained setlist personalization.
